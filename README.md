The BardFuck archives carried on my account üí´

INFORMATION : 

**Bardfuck is a project of which I was the creator with LaReunion974 who helped me a little and therefore, it was about an organization and I decided to put it on my Github because the project is slightly abandoned and it did not appear on my Github, nevertheless I do not delete the organization.THX BARDFUCK!**

CONTINUE THE PROJECT‚ùî

**If someone potentially wants me to continue the project, please let me know. Discord: (frenchcampcp_).
As a reminder, the project consisted of "hacking" Google AI, Bard with keywords and then we could subsequently control it to, for example, ask it to generate malicious code, etc.
This worked at a time when Bard was extremely vulnerable and even after major corrections BardFuck continued to work, at present it still works, but is no longer updated.**
